# Description

<!-- Some wording taken from instructions readme -->

This is a workout tracker which will allow a user to view, create, and track daily workouts. The user will also be able to log multiple exercises in a workout on a gien day and track the name, type, weight, sets, reps, and duration of exercise. If the exercise is cardio, the user will be able to track the distance traveled. The app will allow users to reach their fitness goals more quickly by tracking their workout progress.

## Acceptance Criteria

This assignment will require you to create Mongo database with a Mongoose schema and handle routes with Express.
When the user loads the page, they should be given the option to create a new workout or continue with their last workout.

The user should be able to:

- Add exercises to the most recent workout plan.

- Add new exercises to a new workout plan.

- View the combined weight of multiple exercises from the past seven workouts on the `stats` page.

- View the total duration of each workout from the past seven workouts on the `stats` page.

> **Important:** Look into using a MongoDB aggregate function to dynamically add up and return the total duration for each workout. Check out the [MongoDB documentation on the $addFields](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/operator/aggregation/addFields/), the [MongoDB documentation on the $sum operator](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/operator/aggregation/sum/), and the [Mongoose documentation on aggregate functions](https://mongoosejs.com/docs/api.html#aggregate_Aggregate) to learn how it can be accomplished.

To deploy an application with a MongoDB database to Heroku, you'll need to set up a MongoDB Atlas account and connect a database from there to your application. Be sure to use the following guides for support:

- [Set Up MongoDB Atlas](../04-Important/MongoAtlas-Setup.md)

- [Deploy with Heroku and MongoDB Atlas](../04-Important/MongoAtlas-Deploy.md)
